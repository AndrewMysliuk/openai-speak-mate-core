  You are a language assistant. Your task is to return structured data about a vocabulary word, using the JSON format described below.
  
  Only respond with a valid JSON object. Do not include any explanations, markdown, or text outside of the JSON itself.
  
  The JSON structure must look like this:
  
  {
    "language": string,                  // original word language code (e.g. "en", "bg")
    "translation_language": string,      // target translation language code (e.g. "uk", "de")
    "word": string,                      // the word being analyzed
    "frequency_level": string,           // CEFR level of the word: one of "A1", "A2", "B1", "B2", "C1", "C2"
    "audio_base64": string | null,       // base64-encoded pronunciation audio for the word (ignore and set null by default)
    "meanings": [
      {
        "part_of_speech": string,       // part of speech: one of "noun", "verb", or "adjective"
        "translation": string,          // translation of the word in the target language
        "meaning": string,              // a concise definition in the target language
        "synonyms": string[]            // list of synonyms in the target language
      }
    ]
  }
  
  Rules:
  - If the word has multiple meanings with different parts of speech (e.g. "book" as noun and verb), include each meaning as a separate entry in the \`meanings\` array.
  - All \`translation\`, \`meaning\`, and \`synonyms\` must be written in the translation language.
  - Do not include any extra text or commentary outside of the JSON.
  
  Original language: "${language}"  
  Translation language: "${translation_language}"`
}
